<p>
  The <b>local loopback</b> mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical
  network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. For
  example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL http://localhost to display its
  home page.
  The name localhost normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the <ins><i>Pv6 loopback address
      ::1.</i></ins>

  <strong>network standards</strong> reserve the entire address <ins><i>block 127.0.0.0/8</i></ins> (<small>more than 16
    million addresses</small>) for loopback purposes.[2] That means any packet sent to any of those addresses is looped
  back. The address 127.0.0.1 is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not supported by all
  operating systems. However, they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the host, all listening on the
  same port number. The IPv6 standard assigns only a single address for loopback: ::1.
  <abbr title="The resolution of the name localhost"> to one or more IP addresses is normally configured by the
    following lines in the operating system's hosts file: </abbr>
<pre><q>     127.0.0.1    localhost
      ::1          localhost</q> </pre>

<u>The name may also be resolved by Domain Name System</u> (<small>DNS</small>) servers, but queries for this name
should be resolved locally, and should not be forwarded to remote name servers.

<u>In addition to the mapping of localhost to the loopback addresses</u> (<small>127.0.0.1 and ::1</small>), localhost
may also be mapped to other IPv4 (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to
any loopback address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated loopback address range in the
hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.

In the Domain Name System, the name localhost is reserved as a top-level domain name, originally set aside to avoid
confusion with the hostname used for loopback purposes.[3] IETF standards prohibit domain name registrars from assigning
the name localhost.

<strong>IETF standards</strong>
The name <b>localhost</b> is reserved for loopback purposes by RFC 6761 (<ins>Special-Use Domain Names</ins>),[4] which
achieved the Proposed Standard maturity level in February 2013. The standard sets forth a number of special
considerations governing the use of the name in the Domain Name System:

An <ins><i>IPv4</i></ins> or <ins><i>IPv6</i></ins> address query for the name <u>localhost</u> <s>mustn't always
  resolve</s> must always resolve to the respective loopback address, which is specified in a separate standard.
Applications may resolve the name to a loopback address themselves, or pass it to the local name resolver mechanisms.
When a name resolver receives an address (<small>A or AAAA</small>) query for localhost, it should return the
appropriate loopback addresses, and negative responses for any other requested record types. Queries for localhost
should not be sent to caching name servers.
To avoid burdening the Domain Name System root servers with traffic, caching name servers should never request name
server records for localhost, or forward resolution to authoritative name servers.
<q>DNS registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in the top-level domain localhost</q>.
When authoritative name servers receive queries for 'localhost' <s>in spite</s> of the provisions mentioned resolve them
appropriately.
<abbr title=The IPv4 loopback> addresses are reserved within the IPv4 address space by the <b>IETF</b> "Special Use IPv4
  Addresses" standard (RFC 5735).[5] The reservation can be traced back to the November 1986 "Assigned Numbers" standard
  (RFC 990).</abbr>

In contrast, the <ins><i>IETF</i></ins> <q>"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"</q> standard (<small>RFC 4291</small>)
reserves the single <i>IPv6</i> loopback address ::1 within the IPv6 address space. The standard precludes the
assignment of that address to any physical interface, as well as its use as the source or destination address in any
packet sent to remote hosts. Any such packet that is erroneously transmitted is not supposed to be routed, and should be
dropped by all routers or hosts that receive it.

</h3>
<p>
  The processing of any packet sent to a <strong>loopback address</strong>, is implemented in the link layer of the
  <i>TCP/IP</i> stack. Such packets are never passed to any network interface controller (NIC) or hardware device driver
  and must not appear outside of a computing system, or be routed by any router. This permits software testing and local
  services in the absence of any hardware network interfaces.

  <b>Looped-back</b> packets <s>aren't distinguished</s> are distinguished from any other packets traversing the
  <ins><i>TCP/IP</i></ins> stack only by the special IP address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that
  ultimately receive them respond according to the specified destination. For example, an HTTP service could route
  packets addressed to 127.0.0.99:80 and 127.0.0.100:80 to different Web servers, or to a single server that returns
  different web pages. To simplify such testing, the hosts file may be configured to provide appropriate names for each
  address.

  Packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped. Such
  packets are sometimes referred to as Martian packets.[<sup>6</sup>] As with any other bogus packets, they may be
  malicious and any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

  <ins><i>Special cases</i></ins>
  The releases of the MySQL database differentiate between the use of the hostname localhost and the use of the
  addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.[7] When using localhost as the destination in a client connector interface of an
  application, the MySQL application programming interface connects to the database using a Unix domain socket, while a
  TCP connection via the loopback interface requires the direct use of the explicit address.

  <abbr title=One notable exception><u>to the use of the 127.0.0.0/8 addresses is their use in Multiprotocol Label
      Switching MPLS traceroute error detection, in which their property of not being routable provides a convenient
      means to avoid delivery of faulty packets to end users.</u> </abbr>
